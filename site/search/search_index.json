In the software, select Input Directory and choose the directory that contains the data to be converted (select the main/root directory that contains all subject directories).

If the EDF files are all in the same directory, then the name will be the name of the EDF files. Date: the date the data was recorded. Time: the time the data was recorded. Size: the size of the EDF file in gigabytes. Frequency (adjustable): the frequency the data was recorded at. This is automatically calculated based on information extracted from the EDF file. However, if there is an error then the user can double click on the frequency box and manually change it. Duration: the total duration of the EDF file recording, which is automatically calculated. EDF Type: type of EDF file (EDF+D or EDF+C). This field should always show EDF+C as outlined in the Natus EDF batch export document. Type (selectable): the type of EEG data collected (Intracranial or Scalp). This value is automatically detected by the flags _EEG/_IEEG used in the directory name. This value can be changed by the user if there is an error. Task (selectable): the condition of the recorded file: Full, clip or cortical stimulation (CS). This value is automatically detected by the flags _CLIP/_FULL/_CS used in the directory name. This can be changed by the user if there is an error. Ret/Pro (selectable): whether the data file is retrospective or prospective. This value is automatically detected based on the RET flag used in the directory name.
