It was developed by a few European medical engineers who first met at the 1987 international Sleep Congress in Copenhagen. In March 1990, they agreed upon a very simple file format to exchange their sleep recordings. This format became known as the European Data Format.</p> <p>An extension of EDF, named EDF+, was developed in 2002 and is largely compatible to EDF. However, the EDF+ format provides a few advantages: the files can contain interrupted recordings, annotations can be stored within the file along with stimuli/events. Medical type recordings often contain annotations about patient events, stimulation responses and are often discontinuous as the patient may require breaks during recording time. EDF+ allows for these medical type recordings to be stored much easier. </p> <p>The full specifications can be found on the EDF website. The site also supports users and developers by offering free downloads of files and software, a list of EDF(+) compatible companies and further contact possibilities.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#edf-file-structure","title":"EDF File Structure","text":"<p>EDF/EDF+ files consist of a header (ascii) that describes the contents of the file and the experimental settings.
